Run make.

Ensure port 5000 is not in use on clamshell and crabshell.

On crabshell, run ./server

On clamshell, run ./test

The test client will open/create a file CENSORED (insider joke), and 
try to read, write, seek, and close the file. It will then terminate
after trying to write to the closed file. You can run ./test a second 
time with the already existing file to ensure read will not return
blank if there is data in a file.

To see the results of the write and seek on the file CENSORED, just cat
or less it.

On the first run of ./test, CENSORED will contain "EFGH".

On all subsuquent runs, it will contain "ABCDEFGH".

To check for thread saftey, on clamshell, run bash. Then run the
following command exactly as it is stated without quotes:

"for i in {1..20} ; do ./test & done"

This will run twenty instances of the test client simultaneously.

To check file integrity, the same cat and less can be run on CENSORED
as before. The same "ABCDEFGH" string is expected.
